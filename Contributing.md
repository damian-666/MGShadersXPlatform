THE GOAL IS MAKE SHARED CODE SAMPLES THAT ARE TRULY CODE ONCE/ RUN ANYWHERE AND MAY INLUDE THE FASTEST PERFORMING MODELS AND REVERSIBLE INTEGRATORS FOR SCENTIFIC SIMULATION, VISUALIZATON,
USING MONOGAME AS A DIRECT DEPENENCY IS OK BUT NOT UNLESS ITS ADVANTAGIOUS...

THIS COULD BE LIKE SHADERTOY FOR MONOGAME...

BUT FOR NOW GIVE ME FX SHADERS!   ONCES THAT WORK ON GL, PHONES AND MABYHE CONSOLES , DX UNDER X64 AND ARM. 

I MADE A CLIPPING SHADER.. IT BARELY WORKS AND IS A MESS... DO WHATEVER YO WANT JUST DONT BREAK THAT, OR SHOW ME HOW ITS DONE.
MONOGME NEEDS BETTER SAMPLES.  THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL SAMPLE.    IT MIGHT BE USED TO HELP MAKE SOME FOR THEM TO HELP OUT.

DONT UPDATE STUFF ON THE UPDATE THREAD UNLESS IT REALLY MUST ON THE UI THEAD.    I USE THE PRODUCER CONSUMER PATTERN AND ONLY INTERESTED IN THE DRAW CALL,  AND SHADERS AND RENDERTARGETS USAAGE NOW.

MONOGAME WAS CHOSEN BECAUSE IT HAS A LEGACY API, GOOD FOR 2D VISUALIZATION WITH ZOOMING, SIMPLE GRAPHICS AND LOW LEVEL ABSTRACTION, AND THE GREATEST RANGE OF DEVICES INCLUDING
GAME CONSOLES.    

DONT PUT NDA'D FX CODE IN HERE.   DONT GET ME SUED.. ITS ON YOU IF YOU DO.. NO GPL STUFF.. MIT LICENSE ONLY.

PRs ILL MIGHT MERGE IN ,  INGORE,     SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT I DONT CARE.  JUST MAKE TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT OR SHARE SOME CODE PEOPLE CAN USE THATS VERY COMMON.. CLIPPING... RASTER BASED COLISION
RAY CASTING, SHADOWS, STUFF LIKE THAT.   UPSCALING, FLUIDS, ALL THAT STUFF..   SAVE PEOPLE TIME, YOU SWEAT UR BLOOD OUT, MAYBE THEY WILL SAVE YOU TIME LATER IN RETURN.

NO BULLYING OR MARGINALIZING OR BEING A DICK.  VULGARITY , RANTS, AND FOUL LANGUAGE ARE ALLOWED ENVEN ENCOURAGED.  BUT DONT BORE ME OR WASTE MY TIME,
KEEP IT FUN.  THE GOAL HERE IS TO AVOID SPENDING 1000 HOURS TO DO A SIMPLE THING

I MIGHT ERASE YOUR MAD COMMENTS OR NOT.     CODE OF CONDUCT IS, DO WHATEVER... BUT FOCUS.. THE POINT IS SHADERS AN DRAWING STUFF FAST.
HELPING OTHERS AND DO CHARITY WORK.   $$ WILLNOT BE ACCEPTED.

  NO DISRESPECT .. YOU NEVER KNOW WHO YOU ARE TALKING TO.  DON'T SAY ANYTHING YOU WOULD NOT SAY STANDING NEXT TO THEM.  

EGO.   DONT BRING  ONE.     LEARN TO LEARN ,  BEING WRONG IS BETTER THAN PROVING YOUR SMARTER THAN ANYONE.  THAT MEANS YOU LEARNED,  SOMETHING , YOU WON.

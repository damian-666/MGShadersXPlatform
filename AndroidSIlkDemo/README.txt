THIS WAS A FAILED EXPERIMENT, I LEAVE IT FOR NOW BUT I DONT PLAN NOT UPDATE IT ANYMORE. AMBYE AS A TEST BED FOR OTHER SILK COMPONENTS THAT
MIGHT BE USEFUL SUCH AS AUDIO AND SUCH.  

SILK IS MORE BLOATED THAN MONOGAME IN MY SAMPLE

IMAGESHARP HAS A NEW LICENSE ADN ITS NOT MIT..  ANYWASY DONT NEED THIS , DONT HELP

SILK WINDOWING AND MONOGAME DONT FIT  <-  i wrote this.
AI suggested next line: 
""I WILL TRY TO MAKE IT WORK WITH https://github.com/SFML/SFML"  <--- LOL	this is what Git Copilot wrote for me.. whatetever.    I wont bother to try it but i mighthave cludes to som stuff
like Avalon and OpenGl and Monogame interpot.. i doubt it.   


NEXT WINDOWS EXPERIMENT MIGHT BE AVALONIA AS RE REPLACEMENT FOR WPF , FOR LEVEL EDITING AND WINDOWNG.. WITH DOCKING AND EVERTYHING
FOR TOUCH MYRA MIGHT BE A GOOD APPROACH FRO INGAME EDITING AS WELL AS IMGUI AND THEY WORK TOGETHER.. SOME PARTS AND METHODOLOGY OF SILK 
MIGHT HELP MAINTAIN THE BINDINGS USED INSIDE MONOGAME BUT IM NOT A CORE CONTRITBUTOR TO MONOGAME 
AND I DONT DO LOW LEVEL CODING IM A GAME DESIGNER, I MAKE APP LEVEL CODE TOOLING , PHYSICS, FLUIDS , AND CREATURES TAHT BITE ASS.
